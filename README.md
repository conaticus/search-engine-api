# Search Engine API

This is the API that interacts with the database index for my second attempt at a search engine. It takes all keywords from the query and uses TF-IDF search and Cosine similarity to order the website results and send the back to the client.

This runs in conjunction with the other two repositories:
- [Crawler](https://github.com/conaticus/search-engine-crawler)
- [Client Side](https://github.com/conaticus/search-engine-client)
